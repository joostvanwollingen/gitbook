# Setting up a development environment

## Virtual Machine

Setting up a development environment is part of being a toolsmith, but tonight we don't want you to waste too much time on configuring all kinds of things. That's why we've made a VM available with all the neccessary dependencies.

1. [Download and install Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Download the Meetup.ova \(TODO: add link\)
3. Import Meetup.ova in Virtual Box \(just double click the .ova file\)
4. Start the VM

## Manual setup

We recommend using the VM to get the most out of the meetup. If you'd rather install the tools yourself, please find the instructions below.

Please note: Windows is currently not supported by Cypress.io, so use the VM in that case.
